Corpus of Eighteenth Century Prose Fiction

## Description

*C18P* is a **9.7 million word corpus** of eighteenth century prose fiction, covering the period from 1700-1830. It thus represents prose fiction during a period in which it became increasingly popular and during which 'the novel' as we know it today started taking shape. 

The corpus contains short fiction as well as novels and aims to represent the most important forms, genres -- such as travelogues, the sentimental novel, and Gothic fiction -- and authors of prose fiction (for background information on these forms, genres, authors and publication data of the period see sources below).

The corpus is subdivided into three periods, which correspond to three important stages in the development of prose fiction during the eighteenth century: 
- 1700-1745: Focus on satire, very early examples of the novel 
- 1746-1785: Beginning of the age of prose fiction
- 1786-1830: Romantic period, height of early Gothic fiction, many texts by female writers

(see Norton Anthology of English Literature, Raven).

The texts in the corpus are all available in the public domain and were sourced from Project Gutenberg, Project Gutenberg Australia, and the Oxford Text Archive. Complete texts were used whenever possible.
